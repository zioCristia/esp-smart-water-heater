# esp-smart-water-heater
Esp32 based pcb to transform your boiler in a smart one and to integrate it into your domotic home.
Any possibility of improvement is accepted.

With this board you can:
  - control the power on and off of the heater thanks to a relay
  - measure the temperature of the water
  - visualize data to an LCD
  - have a Wi-Fi capabilities to integrate the heater in your domotic network

I've used an esp32 board powered from an AC-DC transoformer.
